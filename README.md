# Medinology-android
인공신경망을 활용한 약 처방 시스템

Its a project for school contest. I developed it with my friends. Its a program that shows a disease name and required medicine when users check their symptoms. I learned Deep learning, java skills, reading/modifying/debugging Visual Basic codes, android development, and usage of JNI.This project earned us a big award.
